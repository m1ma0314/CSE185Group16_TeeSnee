# CSE185Project t-SNE implementation
This is group 16 final project for CSE185. It follows the algorithm description in  the [original t-SNE parper](https://lvdmaaten.github.io/publications/papers/JMLR_2008.pdf) to implement t-SNE tool.

[BACK TO TABLE OF CONTENTS](#toc)


Installation requires the `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `scikit-learn` libraries to be installed. You can install these with `pip`:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Once required libraries are installed, you can install `tsne` with the following command:
```

```

Functions Draft:

Algorithm as described in original t-sne paper https://lvdmaaten.github.io/publications/papers/JMLR_2008.pdf

1. Open & organize data into dataframe:
  * Read in data as a pandas dataframe 
  * Convert data into high dimensional space 
  * Use numpy 2D array
  
2. Calculate pairwise distances between all data points:
  * for each vector (representing the cell), look at each index (representing the gene counts) and subtract to a second cell at the same index
  * calculate distance between each cell, euclidean distance = sqrt(sum(subtracted values for each index))
  * repeat for all cells 
  * store distances in 2D numpy array 
  
3. Calculate similarity matrix
  *  For each cell, subtract all other cell x cell 1D matrices from current cellâ€™s 1D matrix
  *  Get sum of values calculated in previous step
  *  *how to calculate sigma???*
  *  sigma is determined by binary search using a perplexity value 
  *  the perplexity value is related to Shannon Entropy value
  *  normalize similarity matrix

  * *what is y?* 

5. Calculate symmetrical probabilities

  * Check that sum of probabilities of i from j is greater than 1/2n
  
6. Calculate gradient function of symmetrical probabilities

  * Once gamma(t) converges (no longer changes after x number of iterations) we have identified the low dimensional map 
   
9. Plot
